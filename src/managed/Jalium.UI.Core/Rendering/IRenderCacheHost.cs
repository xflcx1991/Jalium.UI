/// <para>
/// The contract is: when a visual is about to invoke <c>OnRender</c> the render
/// loop asks the host for a recorder, passes the recorder to <c>OnRender</c>
/// instead of the live drawing context, finishes recording to obtain an opaque
/// <em>Drawing</em> handle, caches the handle on the visual, and replays it
/// against the live drawing context. Subsequent frames skip <c>OnRender</c>
/// entirely until the visual marks itself render-dirty — then the cached
/// handle is discarded and the cycle repeats.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The recorder returned by <see cref="CreateRecorder"/> must inherit from
/// <see cref="DrawingContext"/> (so it accepts every draw / push / pop call)
/// and also implement the Core-side drawing-context interfaces
/// (<c>IOffsetDrawingContext</c>, <c>IClipDrawingContext</c>,
/// <c>IOpacityDrawingContext</c>, <c>ITransformDrawingContext</c>,
/// <c>IClipBoundsDrawingContext</c>) so the existing <c>RenderDirect</c>
/// pipeline can use it interchangeably with the live context.
